Welcome to CSE15L!
Today we will be learning how to use remote access in three simple steps.
* Installing VSCode 
* Remotely Connecting
* Trying Some Commands

## Installing VS Code
* If VSCode is not already installed on your computer, go to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/)	to download and install VSCode version that corresponds with your operating system.
* Once VSCode is properly installed on your system open the application.
* Please note that it may be different color themes, menu bars, etc because of the variation of systems and settings available.

## Remotely Connecting
* If you are a Windows user, you need to download and install Git which can be found [here](https://gitforwindows.org/).
* You will then also need to set your default terminal to Git Bash in VS Code using these [instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994). 
* You will now go to your terminal and type in the command below replacing zz with the letters in your course specific account; answer yes to the prompt if it is your first time logging in.
